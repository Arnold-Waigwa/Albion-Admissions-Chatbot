**AI-Powered Admissions Chatbot for Albion College**


**Overview:**

This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist prospective and current students at Albion College by providing accurate and helpful information related to college life, admissions, and campus resources. The chatbot is built using Python and is based on the Eliza skeleton, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversations.

**Features**
- Seamless Interaction: Provides users with accurate and relevant responses through a robust knowledge base designed using key-word template rules.
- NLP-based Conversations: Built on the Eliza skeleton, the chatbot mimics human interactions, improving the user experience.
- Comprehensive Support: Offers guidance on various aspects of student life, from admissions processes to general campus information.

**Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- NLP Foundation: Eliza skeleton
- Libraries: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing
- Storage: The chatbot's knowledge base is built with key-word template rules that enable it to deliver customized and contextually relevant responses.

**How It Works**
- Input Handling: The chatbot receives input from the user, which is parsed to identify key words and phrases.
- Response Generation: Based on the identified keywords, the chatbot matches the input to predefined templates and generates a response from its knowledge base.
- Adaptive Conversations: The chatbot uses Elizaâ€™s conversation model to maintain the flow of dialogue, ensuring the interaction feels natural.

**Use Cases**
- Prospective Students: Help students get detailed information about the application process, scholarships, and campus tours.
- Current Students: Offer support on finding resources such as student organizations, academic help, and general campus life inquiries.
